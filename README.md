## About The Project

The Inventory Management System is a web-based application designed to help businesses efficiently track, manage, and report on their product inventory in real-time. Built with the Laravel PHP framework, the system offers a robust set of features tailored for warehouses, retail stores, wholesalers, and distribution businesses. The system includes product management, purchase and sales tracking, supplier handling, stock adjustment, and comprehensive reporting â€” all managed through an intuitive admin dashboard with dynamic charts. With multi-warehouse support, role-based access control, and real-time stock monitoring, it provides full visibility into inventory operations.
